         they can possibly send, as a demo of what that alert will look like when displayed.
         This is mainly to make it easy to tell which items are still missing appropriate
         icons or background colors.  The NWS Logo on a gray background is the default used
         if nothing else has been set. Please visit
         https://github.com/justdave/nwsweatheralertswidget/issues to suggest icons or colors.</string>
